    Each overlap strip shared with an already-sampled neighbor splits into a
    FROZEN segment on the seam side (mask 0, keeps the neighbour's content) and
    a FADE segment (mask 0 -> 1) toward the tile interior; 0 fade = whole strip
    frozen. Width and height axes use independent overlap and fade lengths, and
    every edge (top/bottom/left/right) is handled. frozen_w/frozen_h give each
    axis an explicit fully-frozen width instead of the implicit ol - fade split.

    flat_val: when set, the fade band is a spatially UNIFORM constant instead
    of a linspace ramp. The invariant that matters in H3 is per-token
    LABEL-INPUT CONSISTENCY: the mask value becomes each 2x2-pooled token's
    timestep label AND mixes that token's input (m*noise + (1-m)*anchor ==
    the anchor noised to level m*sigma), so any mode keeping label and input
    equal per token reads as "partially preserved content" the model extends
    from the anchor. A uniform band is consistent even at the patch level (a
    constant pools to itself); a ramp is consistent per pixel but its pooled
    label takes each patch's max (a mild sub-patch mismatch) - empirically
    both work, flat slightly ahead. What does NOT work is pairing a binary
    label with a ramped input (fade_mode 'hybrid'): clean anchor content
    labelled as full noise is read as noise structure (strange/disconnected
    content). The ORIGINAL mosaic came from per-step fade_steps rebuilds
    desyncing the once-baked labels, not from a static ramp. Uniform m also

    """Sample every tile and stitch them into one AV latent per a tile_plan.

    `tconds` / `negative_list` / `latents` are lists aligned to plan placements
    (latents used for their per-tile size and the shared audio). `ol_ws` /
    `ol_hs` / `fws` / `fhs` are per-tile overlap/fade extents (latent tokens),
    indexed by tile; the anchor tile never uses them. When `skip_first` is set,
    the anchor tile (latents[0]) is not sampled: its already-generated video and
    audio are dropped straight into the canvas and the extension tiles sample
    around it.

    fade_mode shapes the fade band's noise mask. The invariant that matters in
    H3 is per-token LABEL-INPUT CONSISTENCY: the conds mask is pooled to the
    2x2 token grid and becomes each token's timestep label, while the sampler
    mixes the token's input with the same mask value (m*noise + (1-m)*anchor
    == the anchor noised to level m*sigma). A mode is stable when each token's
    label matches its input:
      'flat'     - one constant fade_val over the whole band. Consistent even
                   at the patch level (a constant pools to itself). Empirically
                   the most stable mode.
      'gradient' - legacy linear 0->1 ramp (fade_val ignored). Consistent per
                   pixel, but patch-pooled labels take each 2x2 patch's max -
                   a mild sub-patch mismatch. Empirically close to flat. (The
                   original mosaic came from per-step fade_steps rebuilds that
                   desynced the once-baked labels, not from a static ramp.)
      'hybrid'   - same conds mask as 'gradient' (labels stay consistent), but
                   the masked-input mix is patched during sampling: instead of
                   the stock m*x + (1-m)*injected mix (whose anchor is scaled
                   to (1-m) brightness - out of distribution for mid m), each
                   masked pixel's input is rebuilt as anchor + pool(m)*sigma*eps
                   - a FULL-STRENGTH anchor noised to exactly the level its
                   label claims, the same construction as H3's reference
                   tokens. Targets the fade band's residual grain. Experimental.
    fade_val: mask value of the fade band in 'flat' mode; lower = stronger
    freeze (more neighbour content preserved), higher = more noise injected /
    freer generation. 0 = fully frozen band, 1 = mask off.
    `masked_area_noise` raises every mask value toward 1 (all three roles at
    once). Returns (acc_video, out_audio, tiles_info, t0) where t0 is tile 0's
    raw sample_piece output (None when the anchor came from skip_first)."""

Anchors only the seam, so the rest generates freely.
